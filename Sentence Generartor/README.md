# Deep-Learning-Projects
Sentence Generator is a deep learning tool to generate the english sentence given the first character. This is implemented in python language with using popular modules such as tensorflow, numpy etc.

To train:
    python Models.py
    
Training may take for approx 20-24 hour on GPU version of tensorflow. CPU versions with few cores will take much longer time. So, it is recommended to train this model on machines with GPU Tensorflow installed.
